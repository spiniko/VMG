# Validation Message Generator (VMG) 
   
The **Validation Message Generator (VMG)** is a bookmarklet (also known as a favlet), which is a small JavaScript program stored as a URL within a bookmark in your web browser. When you click/activate the bookmark, the script runs on the current webpage and it performs specific actions, such as manipulating the DOM, extracting information, or automating tasks.

## How to Create the VMG Bookmarklet
- In your web browser, open the bookmarks manager or right-click the bookmarks bar and select “Add Page” or “Add Bookmark”.     
- Paste the JavaScript Code: In the URL field of the new bookmark, replace any existing URL with the JavaScript code from the [VMG script](vmgweb.min.js).  
- Name the Bookmark: Give the bookmark a descriptive name like “Validation Message Generator” or “VMG.”.  
- Save the Bookmark: Save the bookmark in your browser’s bookmarks bar or a folder for easy access.

## How to Use the VMG Bookmarklet
  
### Precondition: 
- Create the VMG Bookmarklet.
- Ensure you are on the `Finding Details` page in the platform.
___
- **Step 1:** Perform the necessary validation and set the appropriate status for the finding (e.g., Fixed, Not Fixed, Partially Fixed).  
- **Step 2:** Activate the VMG bookmarklet from your browser bookmarks.  
- **Step 3:** A native browser alert will confirm whether the validation message was successfully generated.  
- **Step 4:** If the message is generated, upon dismissing the browser alert, the browser will automatically scroll down and focus on the comment box where the validation message has been injected.  
- **Step 5:** Review the generated message, make any necessary edits, and post the comment. 
- **Step 6:** Upload the corresponding screenshot, ensuring that the _**filename**_ matches the _**autogenerated screenshot name**_ provided in the validation message.

## Validation Message Example:  
   
```
Validation Test Location: https://www.example.com/
Environment: Windows 10 | Chrome v127.0.0.0
Testing Tools: Chrome Browser Dev tools, NVDA screen reader, Keyboard, Accessible Color Picker, Headings Map Extension
Final Status: Not fixed
Screenshot (attached): ABC-AMP1_08082024_Fixed_Validation.png
Notes: The issue initially reported is fixed.
Recommendation: We recommend following the original guidance.
```

***Current Limitation***: The tool is currently designed to generate messages exclusively for **WEB** validations. 
___

### Validation Test Location
`Validation Test Location: https://www.example.com/`  
  
The test location is the URL provided on the platform's **finding details page** and will be captured automatically.  
  
**IMPORTANT**: In some cases, the client may provide alternative URLs, such as sandbox environments, for validation testing. You may need to manually update the URL to match the environment provided by the client.
___

### Environment
`Environment: Windows 10 | Chrome v127.0.0.0`  
  
The operating system, browser name, and browser version are automatically detected.   
  
Supported browsers include Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.  
Supported operating systems are macOS, Windows, and Linux.
___

### Testing Tools
`Testing Tools: Chrome Browser Dev tools, NVDA screen reader, Keyboard, Accessible Color Picker, Headings Map Extension`   
  
A predefined (hardcoded) list of commonly used accessibility tools for validation testing is provided.   
You can customize the list by adding or removing tools as needed before posting.
___

### Final Status
`Final Status: Not fixed`   
  
The current status from the finding details page is captured automatically.  
    
**IMPORTANT**: Make sure the issue is not in the `Open` or `To Review` status to allow the message to generate.  
___

### Screenshot Name
`Screenshot (attached): ABC-AMP1_08082024_Fixed_Validation.png`   
   
The screenshot name is autogenerated using the following pattern: `${issueKey}_${formattedDate}_${finalStatus}_Validation.png`, where:  
- `issueKey` is the finding's unique identifier (e.g., `ABC-AMP1`).
- `formattedDate` is in the format `MMDDYYYY` (e.g.`08082024`).
- `finalStatus` reflects the current status of the issue: `Fixed`, `Not_Fixed`, `Partially_Fixed`, `Cannot_Be_Fixed`, `Not_Reproducible` or `Dismissed`. 
  
**IMPORTANT**: Don't forget to *upload your screenshot* along with posting the comment. Ensure that the **autogenerated screenshot name** matches the **actual screenshot name** you will upload.  
___

### Notes 
`Notes: The issue initially reported is fixed.`  
   
A boilerplate note will be provided - if the issue is `Fixed`, you can likely use the message as is. Otherwise, update the message according to the status and context.
___

### Recommendation
`Recommendation: We recommend following the original guidance.`  
  
This section is conditionally generated only when the issue status is `Not Fixed` or `Partially Fixed`.   
Adjust the message based on your scenario and provide the needed guidance on how to fix the issue.
___
## TODOs   
  
***Planned Enhancements***: Extend the Validation Message Generator (VMG) to support generating validation messages for **iOS** and **Android** validations.
